         So it seems I'm
      not breathing And now my dreams are nothing like they were meant to be And
      I'm breaking down, I think I'm breaking down And I'm afraid To sleep
      because of what haunts me Such as living with the uncertainty That I'll
      never find the words to say Which would completely explain Just how I'm
      breaking down [Chorus] Someone come and, someone come and save my life
      Maybe I'll sleep when I am dead But now it's like the night is taking
      sides With all the worries that occupy the back of my mind Could it be
      this misery will suffice? [Gordon Downie] I've become A simple souvenir of
      someone's kill And like the sea I'm constantly changing from calm to ill
      Madness fills my heart and soul as if the great divide could swallow me
      whole oh, how I'm breaking down [Chorus] oooohhh my life Someone come and,
      someone come and save my life (save my life) Someone come and, someone
      come and save my life (save my life) Someone come and, someone come and
      save my life Could it be this misery will suffice?
